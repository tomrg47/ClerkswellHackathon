# ClerkswellHackathon

Restore Hope brief:
Solution Ally a LLM system for both the families and workers/volunteers

The aim take open honest feelings from the families on what they are struggling with and use an llm to transform that into a categorised and prioritised data and a development plan, the aim is to assign these families a two word random username and also a qr code so they can remain anonymous. The system will then show workers who input the username or scan the qr code some reccomended areas of conversations so the families are able to continue on their journey.
