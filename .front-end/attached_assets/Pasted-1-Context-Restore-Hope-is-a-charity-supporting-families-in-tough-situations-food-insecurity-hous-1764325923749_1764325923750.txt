1. Context

Restore Hope is a charity supporting families in tough situations (food insecurity, housing issues, income shocks, safety concerns, health problems).

They want a dignified digital experience that:

Helps families quickly understand what to do next in a crisis.

Makes it easy for staff to see people’s needs, record engagement, and track progress over time.

Is simple, mobile-friendly, and usable by people with low digital confidence.

The AI concept is:

“An AI support worker with a laminated flowchart — but with much nicer UX.”

2. Core Idea to Implement

Build a small web MVP with two main parts:

A. Crisis Helper Agent (rules + LLM)

Input: user types free-text crisis messages, e.g.

“My landlord has served a notice.”

“My energy is about to be cut off.”

“I have no food until Monday.”

Engine behaviour (must be rule-based, not pure LLM):

Assess urgency: hours | days | weeks.

Categorise into one main need category:
Housing | Food | Income | Safety | Health.

Run through a hand-crafted decision tree / state machine for that category, asking short, structured questions such as:

“Have you already spoken to your council’s housing options team?”

“Are there children in your household?”

“Are you currently at risk of violence at home?”

The decision tree outputs a ranked action plan, e.g.

“Call X line (open now).”

“Go to Y office (address, opening times, what to bring).”

“Ask Z for an emergency hardship payment.”

LLM is only used for:

Understanding free-text and mapping it into structured fields the engine needs (category, urgency, key facts / flags).

Generating friendly, low-jargon explanations of the next steps.

NO hallucinated services:

The system must only ever suggest services from a vetted service registry (a local JSON / DB table you define with 5–10 example services).

Output format (API):

category

urgency

questions (if more info needed)

action_plan[] with:

priority_rank

title

description

service_id (from registry)

risk_flags[] (e.g. “children_in_household”, “domestic_violence_risk”).

B. Progress & Engagement Tracking (two-sided)

For families (user side):

Very simple “My Journey” screen, showing:

Basic profile info (first name / household nickname).

“What you told us you’re struggling with” (top 1–2 categories).

List of actions suggested and which ones they’ve marked as “done”.

List of events attended (community sessions, workshops, etc.).

A basic booking / register-interest flow for events (name + phone/email + pick an event).

For staff / volunteers (charity side):

Light “admin dashboard” that shows:

List of families (or anonymised IDs) with:

latest category, urgency, and risk flags

last contact date

Activity log: crisis chats, events attended, actions recommended.

Simple filters: by category, by urgency (e.g. see all “hours” urgency cases).

Data capture principles:

Keep forms super short and mobile-friendly.

Assume users may not like long forms or techy language.

Use simple copy: “What are you struggling with most right now?” instead of jargon.
